I have added this text to the readme.md on the remote origin master.

I would like to add this text (basically, changes to the readme.md file) to my new local branch "branch_for_stash_test (BFST)".

I will attempt git stash of my changes to my local branch "BFST"

I will then do a git pull origin master.

This should pull the most current changes from the remote origin master into my local BFST branch.

The file I created: "new_branch_change/md", should then not exist in my local BFST branch.

The modified remote origin master "readme.md" (this file, with this text), should now be in my local branch "BFST".

Let's do it...
